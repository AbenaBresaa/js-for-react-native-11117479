 Task 1: arrayManipulation.js

* CreateD a JavaScript file named `arrayManipulation.js` and wrote a function `processArray` that takes an array of numbers as an argument and returns a new array where each even number is squared and each odd number is tripled.


 Task 2: arrayManipulation.js

* In the same file I added a function `formatArrayStrings` which takes two arrays as arguments: an array of strings and an array of numbers processed by `processArray`.
* The function modifies each string based on its corresponding number: capitalize the entire string if the number is even, convert the string to lowercase if the number is odd.


Task 3: userInfo.js

* Created the last file `userInfo.js`.Wrote a function `createUserProfiles` that takes an array of names and the array of modified names from Task 2.
* The function returns an array of objects, each containing `originalName`, `modifiedName`, and `id` (auto-incremented starting from 1).
